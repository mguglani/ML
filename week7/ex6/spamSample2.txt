Spooktacular Midweek Deals in Pennsylvania

STARTING AT $117
 
October midweeks at Woodloch Resort are all about the thrill and chill of autumn highlighted by Haunted Hayrides through their nature trail. With rates starting at $117 and including two meals daily, accommodations, resort amenities, and nightly entertainment, missing out on this deal would be... well... scary! Most importantly, kids six and under stay for free and kids 19 and younger stay for half off! On Woodloch's Haunted Hayride, guests will wind their way through elaborate sets filled with special effects, music, and live actors. The hayride is not for the faint of heart or for small children, so Woodloch provides spooky alternatives such as their costume party, Halloween Parade, and Boo-Lympics. The deal is only valid Sunday-Thursday through the month of October, so book now!
